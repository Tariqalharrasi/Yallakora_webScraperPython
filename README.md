## A simple program in Web Scraping using python

I wrote this code to show the simple structure of web scraping. I used the [Yallkora](https://www.yallakora.com/?nav-logo) website.
I scraped the data of the matches showing the Champion's title, Team A, Team B, Match time, and Score.
Then I store all the data in a CSV file.
